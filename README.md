# CODENAMES
This is a computer-based implementation of the [CODENAMES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)) [board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames) that allows users to seed the same random game on multiple computers and play virtually.

This was completed as a personal project when spring break was extended for the COVID19 pandemic. I wanted to play games with my family at a distance and used this project as a way to learn a new Python package (tkinter).

## Usage
To play, simply run the *codenames.py* file.
```bash
python codenames.py
```
Then, input the same random number on all computers being used. When prompted, indicate if you are the spymaster. This will enable/disable the color-coding of the agent cards.

You can show the allegiances of all agents with the "Reveal Board" button. To play again, you can reset the board while maintaining seed coordination with the "New Game" button.
